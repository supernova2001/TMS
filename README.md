**Key Features:**

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implemented a robust 2FA system to enhance account security, with support for various 2FA methods including authenticator apps.

2. **Itinerary Creation**: Provided an intuitive interface for users to create detailed itineraries, including destinations, activities, accommodations, transportation details, and more. Allow uploading images, documents, and attachments, as well as customizing the itinerary layout and branding.

3. **Itinerary Sharing**: Enabled users to share their itineraries with others, such as travel companions, tour operators, or travel agents, with access controls and permission levels for view-only, edit, or collaborative editing. Support real-time updates and synchronization across devices and users.

4. **User Management**: Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (tour operators, travel agents, individual travelers). Allow users to create and manage personal profiles, and enable tour operators and travel agencies to manage their business profiles and offerings.

5. **Search and Filtering**: Provided advanced search and filtering capabilities for finding relevant itineraries based on destinations, dates, activities, and other criteria, with auto-complete and suggestion features.

6. **Notifications and Reminders**: Sent notifications and reminders to users for upcoming trips, itinerary updates, and other important events, via email, push notifications, and in-app notifications.

7. **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrated with popular travel services and APIs (e.g., booking platforms, maps, weather APIs) to enhance functionality and user experience. Allow users to import or export itineraries to and from other travel planning tools or services.

8. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application is responsive and optimized for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

9. **Analytics and Reporting**: Provided analytics and reporting features for tour operators and travel agencies to track itinerary performance, user engagement, and other relevant metrics.

10. **Admin Panel**: Developed a comprehensive admin panel for system administrators to manage users, roles, and configurations, monitor system activity, handle user support requests, and maintain the overall application.

The Tour Management System is developed following industry best practices, including version control with Git, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and thorough testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end).
